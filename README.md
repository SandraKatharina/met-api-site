# MET API

This App is build with the Framework Vue.js.
The task was to chose an API and fetch and visualize the data.
Since I am an art enthusiast I was excited to find out that the
Metropolitan Museum of Art New York offers a public RESTful API web service in JSON format including
all digitalized objects of the museum's collection.

## random fetch of the digital collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art New York

The App is still a work in progress. Aim is to show a random object
of the collection by reloading the site. For now it fetches the object title, date and picture.
The shown object only changes by inserting a number between 1 and 470 000 manually inside the code.
Not every object has a picture.

The App is deployed via render: https://met-api-site.onrender.com
